/**
 * `_session/list/subscribe`: pushes the changed rows of a cwd's session list
 * to a `sessionIndex` client.
 *
 * A subscription covers the sessions of its cwd and of the same subdirectory
 * in every linked worktree (the `includeWorktrees` scope of the list), in any
 * archive state. All subscriptions of one cwd share one {@link ScopeWatch}:
 * a non-recursive `fs.watch` on each project directory of the scope, the
 * stats of its transcripts, and the row of each session read since. The
 * registry and the projects root are watched once per connection.
 *
 * Subscribe reads no row: it opens the watchers, stats the transcripts and
 * reads the registry. A row is read on the first
 * event of its session and sent unconditionally; later rows are compared
 * with it.
 *
 * - A transcript event names the file: only that file is stat'ed and, when
 *   it changed, its metadata read again (the index's metadata cache and tail
 *   scan).
 * - A registry event names the record: only that record is read, and only
 *   the sessions whose record changed get their `state` recomputed.
 * - A session this connection runs reports its SDK state at once.
 * - A session whose transcripts this connection wrote (a rename, archive,
 *   unarchive or delete) is stat'ed and read again at once, without waiting
 *   for its transcript event.
 *
 * Events are coalesced: 150 ms after the last one, at most 1 s after the
 * first. Each subscription compares a recomputed row with the last row it
 * sent; a change of `updatedAt` alone is no change. A session is sent at most
 * once a second per subscription. A rescan every 10 s stats the scope again
 * and reads the transcripts whose stat changed (or whose last read
 * failed), which covers events `fs.watch` missed;
 * the state of a live session ages from the metadata the index holds.
 *
 * Delivery is best effort: there is no resync and no sequence number; the
 * client also reads the list now and then.
