/**
 * AI-generated session titles.
 *
 * Claude Code's own auto-title generation never runs under the Agent SDK — the
 * latch that arms it is pre-set in the headless path — so `SDKSessionInfo.summary`
 * degrades to the raw first prompt. This module asks the CLI for a real title
 * instead, via the `generate_session_title` control request, and publishes it
 * over ACP as a `session_info_update`.
 *
 * {@link SessionTitles} holds the per-session state and is owned by `Session`.
 * `acp-agent.ts` drives it from four places: {@link SessionTitles.onPrompt} and
 * {@link SessionTitles.onAssistantText} to collect text,
 * {@link SessionTitles.onTurnEnd} at `session_state_changed: idle`, and
 * {@link SessionTitles.reset} on `conversation_reset`.
